Multiple selections (multi-cursor)
VS Code supports multiple cursors for fast simultaneous edits.
You can add secondary cursors (rendered thinner) with Alt+Click.
Each cursor operates independently based on the context it sits in.

A common way to add more cursors is with ⌥⌘↓ or ⌥⌘↑ that insert cursors below or above.

⌘D selects the word at the cursor, or the next occurrence of the current selection.

Multi cursor selection
To add cursors at arbitrary positions,
select a position with your mouse and use Alt+Click (Option+Click on macOS).

To set cursors above or below the current position use:
Keyboard Shortcut: ⌥⌘↑ or ⌥⌘↓

You can add additional cursors to all occurrences of the current selection with ⇧⌘L.

If you do not want to add all occurrences of the current selection, you can use ⌘D instead.
This only selects the next occurrence after the one you selected so you can add selections one by one.
