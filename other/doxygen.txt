4. exclude non-business-logic related stuff to make a clearer call graph.
    add the following configuration in Doxyfile:

# https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/config.html ,

# If this tag is empty the current directory is searched ,
#INPUT                  = myfile.cpp /usr/src/myproject

# If left blank the following patterns are tested: *.c, *.cc, *.cxx, *.cxxm, *.cpp, *.cppm, *.ccm, *.c++, *.c++m, *.java, .. ,
#FILE_PATTERNS          =

# relative paths are relative to the directory from which Doxygen is run ,
EXCLUDE                = /usr/src/myproject/test  /usr/src/myproject/foo.h

# the wildcards are matched against the file with absolute path ,
EXCLUDE_PATTERNS       = */test/* *codec.cpp moc_* */compat/* */3rdparty/*

# symbol name can be a fully qualified name, a word, or if the wildcard * is used, a substring ,
EXCLUDE_SYMBOLS        = functionName1, functionName2, ClassName1, ANamespace, AClass, ANamespace::AClass, ANamespace::*Test
