int a = INT_MAX;
int b = INT_MAX;
long int c = a * b; // error
long int c = (long int)(a * b); // error, conversion, it happens too late

Under C's integral promotion rules, the multiplication is carried out
using int arithmetic, and the result may overflow or be truncated before
being promoted and assigned to the long int left-hand side.
Use an explicit cast on at least one of the operands to force long arithmetic:

    int a = INT_MAX;
    int b = INT_MAX; // or, long b = INT_MAX;
    long int c = (long int)a * b;
    long int d = ((long int)a) * b;
    long int e = (1L * a) * b;

How can I ensure that integer arithmetic doesn't overflow?

The usual approach is to test the operands against the limits in the
header file <limits.h> before doing the operation. For example,
here is a ``careful'' addition function:

int
chkadd(int a, int b)
{
    if(INT_MAX - b < a) {
        fputs("int overflow\n", stderr);
        return INT_MAX;
    }
    return a + b;
}

Here is a complete set of three functions for ``careful''
addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
(Note: these functions are still not perfect, and may fail if invoked on
various edge cases, such as the smallest negative integer, INT_MIN.)

#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>

int
chkadd(int a, int b)
{
    if(b < 0)
        return chksub(a, -b);
    if(INT_MAX - b < a) {
        fputs("int overflow\n", stderr);
        return INT_MAX;
    }
    return a + b;
}

int
chksub(int a, int b)
{
    if(b < 0)
        return chkadd(a, -b);
    if(INT_MIN + b > a) {
        fputs("int underflow\n", stderr);
        return INT_MIN;
    }
    return a - b;
}

int
chkmul(int a, int b)
{
    int sign = 1;
    if(a == 0 || b == 0) return 0;
    if(a < 0) { a = -a; sign = -sign; }
    if(b < 0) { b = -b; sign = -sign; }
    if(INT_MAX / b < a) {
        fputs("int overflow\n", stderr);
        return (sign > 0) ? INT_MAX : INT_MIN;
    }
    return sign * a * b;
}

// https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/implicit_conversion

prvalues of small integral types (such as char) may be converted to
prvalues of larger integral types (such as int).

In particular, arithmetic operators do not accept types smaller
than int as arguments, and integral promotions are automatically applied
after lvalue-to-rvalue conversion, if applicable.

2.7 Type Conversions:
Otherwise, convert char and short to int.

// struct literal, temporary,

struct T{};
(struct T){} = (struct T){};

https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/value_category :
compound literals, which look similar, are lvalues

https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/compound_literal :
The value category of a compound literal is lvalue (its address can be taken)


---


chatGPT:

In both C99 and C11, compound literals are assignable.

According to the C99 and C11 standards, section 6.5.16.1, "The result of
the compound literal is an lvalue." This means that the compound literal
can be assigned to a variable or used as the operand of an assignment
operator.

Here is an example of assigning a compound literal to a variable in C:

int *p = (int []){1, 2, 3};


In this example, the compound literal (int []){1, 2, 3} creates an array
of integers with the values 1, 2, and 3. The array is then assigned to
the pointer variable p.

Therefore, the answer to your question is yes, compound literals in C
are assignable.

If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.

https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/lifetime

Temporary lifetime
Struct and union objects with array members (either direct or members of
nested struct/union members) that are designated by non-lvalue expressions,
have temporary lifetime. Temporary lifetime begins when the expression
that refers to such object is evaluated and ends at
the next sequence point (until C11)
when the containing full expression or full declarator ends (since C11).

Any attempt to modify an object with temporary lifetime results in undefined behavior.

struct T { double a[4]; };
struct T f(void) { return (struct T){3.15}; }
double g1(double* x) { return *x; }
void g2(double* x) { *x = 1.0; }

int main(void)
{
    double d = g1(f().a); // C99: UB access to a[0] in g1 whose lifetime ended
                          //      at the sequence point at the start of g1
                          // C11: OK, d is 3.15
    g2(f().a); // C99: UB modification of a[0] whose lifetime ended at the sequence point
               // C11: UB attempt to modify a temporary object
}


---


// Sequence point occurs:

$ 7.12.1, C A reference manual, 5th
- at the end of a full expression--that is,
    an initializer, an expression statement, the expression in a return
    statement, and the control expressions in a conditional, iterative,
    or switch statement (including each expression in a for statement)
- after the first operand of a &&, ||, ?:, or comma operator
- after the evaluation of the arguments and function expression in a
    function call


---


// https://c-faq.com/expr/seqpoints.html

Between the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its
stored value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.
Furthermore, the prior value shall be accessed only to determine the
value to be stored.

- full expression or expression statement has sequence point at its end,
  subexpresion has sequence point only there is  &&  ||  :?  ,  in it.

- a variable can be modified only once within one single sequence point.

- expressions like i = i + 1 which use and modify i but only modify it later
when it's reasonably easy to ensure that the final store of the final value
(into i, in this case) doesn't interfere with the earlier accesses.


    i = i++;    // error
    i++ * i++;  // error
    i = i + 1;  // ok
    i = i + 1;  // ok
    i++ && i++; // ok


---


https://c-faq.com/expr/confused.html

If an object (as defined above) appears more than once in an expression,
and is the object modified in the expression, make sure that all
appearances of the object which fetch its value participate in the
computation of the new value which is stored.
This rule allows the expression

    i = i + 1

because although the object i appears twice and is modified,
the appearance (on the right-hand side) which fetches i's old value
is used to compute i's new value.
